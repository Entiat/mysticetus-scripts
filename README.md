##Scripts for use in Mysticetus

This repo contains scripts for use in the Mysticetus app. Mysticetus introduced the ability to run user-created C# scripts in build 2022.32 (July 2022).

All scripts live under the MIT license - you can use these for anything, anywhere, anytime, anyhow. All the disclaimers in the license apply, of course. These scripts are not guaranteed or warrantied to be useful for anything. They may have bugs, they may crash apps or your computer, they may cause heartbreak and you may need therapy, and that's all on you. Use at your own risk.
